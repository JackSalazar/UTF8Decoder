This directory contains a set of sth test cases.
  (https://github.com/smf-steve/sth)

These test cases are evaluated via an automated process 
  that is initiated by a `make` recipe, e.g., `make test_java`, 
  or via the following command line.

  $ cd {task}
  $ STH_DRIVER=java_subroutine sth_validate ../test_cases 


# The following environment variables can be defined within
# a file with an extension of `.sth_case`. All such files can
# be placed into a single directory, for example: ../test_cases.
#
#
# | VARIABLE    | Description                        |
# |-------------|------------------------------------|
# | DRIVER      | The default driver program         |
# | OPTIONS     | The options passed to ${DRIVER}    |
#
# | ENTRY       | The entry point to start testing   |
# | ARGS        | The arguments passed to ${ENTRY}   |
# | EXIT_STATUS | The expected exit value            |
#
# | INPUT       | The provided input (stdin)         |
# | OUTPUT      | The expected output (stdout)       |
#
# Notes:
#    - Both ENTRY and EXIT_STATUS must defined (and may not be the empty string)
#    - the value of INPUT can either be a string or a filename
#    - the value of OUTPUT can either be a string or a filename
#
# Effectively, the following command is executed
#
#  $ cat ${INPUT} | ${DRIVER} ${OPTIONS} ${ENTRY} ${ARGS} > {OUTPUT}
#
# NOTE: Programmer must ensure values conform to bash quoting rules
